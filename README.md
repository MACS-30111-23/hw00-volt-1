## Homework Workflow
In this homework assignment, I started by cloning the repository from our GitHub Classroom to create a local copy that I could modify. After making the necessary changes, I used the `git add` and `git commit` commands to stage and commit my updates. Finally, I pushed these committed changes back to my own repository using `git push`. Through this process, I learned how to add hyperlinks to both images and text, which was a new and valuable skill for me.
